# Hearthstone-Discord-Bot

Simple Hearthstone Catalog Discord Bot that I created as part of a small contest that Repl.it was holding.  The bot has one command '!hscard' which can then be following by a valid Hearthstone card and the bot will return info on it as well as a photo of the card.  The gif below demonstrates how it works in Discord.  As part of the contest the project was built on the Repl.it website hence the lack of commits.

Repl.it Project/Source code:

The bot is set up in a way so it will run on the repl.it website so simply forking the repo from Github won't work properly
